# Final Project

##**Why are interested in this field/domain?**

There are a lot of health related problems that are correlated to nutrition/food availability. 
There are certain groups that are unjustly impacted more than others (by these specific diseases/illnesses).
We wanted to look into these relationships and have a better understanding of who is being the most impacted (demographics), 
where geographically it may be occurring the most, and by what specific health concerns.
