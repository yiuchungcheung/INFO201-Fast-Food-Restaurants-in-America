# Final Project

**Why are interested in this field/domain?**

There are a lot of health related problems that are correlated to nutrition/food availability. 
There are certain groups that are unjustly impacted more than others (by these specific diseases/illnesses).
We wanted to look into these relationships and have a better understanding of who is being the most impacted (demographics), 
where geographically it may be occurring the most, and by what specific health concerns. 

**What other examples of data driven projects have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?**

Source 1: [Patterns of Child Health Based on Nutrition](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/66400)

This article talks about how children are impacted by their nutrition on a global scale. It argues that being malnourished from a young age causes irrevocable harm in a child's development, making them more susceptible to noncommunicable diseases( e.g. type II diabetes).This means, on the basis of age, people (adults) may be more predisposed to more food related diseases if they grew up without proper nutrition.

Source 2: [Retail in Food Deserts: Ohio Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5645198/)

This study discusses how the health of residents in food deserts are less healthy (more prone to obesity, heart disease, diabetes). Food deserts are neighborhoods where there are no major grocery retailers within half a mile of most residents. Most stores in these neighborhoods don't have any fresh produce and at best carry canned vegetables. This study examines the correlation between health and income, as these neighborhoods show how lack of access to healthy food affects these residents. 

Source 3: [Can Low-Income Americans Afford a Healthy Diet?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2847733/)

This article finds the correlation between income and how it affects the foods that certain families tend to purchase.  Given that higher-income households are more likely to buy whole grains, seafood, lean meats, low-fat milk, and fresh vegetables and fruit, while lower-income households purchase more cereals, pasta, potatoes, legumes, and fatty meats (more conventional 'junk foods'). 


**What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?**

1) Can low-income Americans afford a healthy diet? 

2) Does the type of food someone is able to afford affect their quality of life?

3) Does more wide spread fast food availability in certain locations affect the health of residents?

4) How does living in an area with more fast food affect children, men, and women differently?

5) Are certain groups of people more likely to live in an area with more fast food options based on race/ethnic background? 


**Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?**

We downloaded the first two data sets from Kaggle.com

Data Set 1: [Fast Food Chains Location data](https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/fast-food-restaurants)

Data Set 2: [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/national-health-and-nutrition-examination-survey)

Data Set 3: [Possible addition?](Include link here)

**How was the data collected or generated?**

_Data Set 1_: The fast food location data came from Datafiniti. They are a web data company that gather a lot of information from several websites and created a database for each category. This specific data set was last updated in 2018. It has information about locations of fast food restaurants nationally (in the U.S.). 

**How many observations (rows) are in your data?**

Number of rows in the data: 9242 

**How many features (columns) are in the data?**

Number of columns in the data: 15  

**What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?**

Looking at this data, we can answer questions regarding specific places within the U.S. that have more fast food locations (availability) than others. We can also look at which fast food chains are more prevalent in certain areas than others. 

_Data Set 2_: This data originally came from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey which is part of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. It is a program that began in the early 1960s that surveys a nationally representative of 5,000 people. It contains demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and other relevant health related information that is a survey. There is also an examination portion in which these individuals undergo a medical examination and lab tests by trained medical professionals. It is organized as a collection of excel files.

**How many observations (rows) are in your data?**

Number of rows in the data: 10.2k (We would have to narrow the data to more recent dates)

**How many features (columns) are in the data?**

Number of columns in the data: 13 to 953

**What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?**

We can answer questions about how location, health, and socioeconomic status are related.
