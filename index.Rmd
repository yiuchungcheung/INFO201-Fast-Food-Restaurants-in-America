## Information on Fast Food Chains (Summary)

Here, in the United States, there is an abundance of fast food chains. Looking at a sample from the top `r get_summary_info(data)$tot_rest` eateries across the country, we get an understanding of how wide spread they are, how popular they are (measured on the basis of the total number of restaurants), and where the highest number of them may be concentrated. 

If we take a look at the data, holistically, the average number of restaurants per state is `r get_summary_info(data)$avg_state`. However, certain states dominant more than others. The states that are most popular for fast food establishments have been `r get_summary_info(data)$top_states` (as abbreviated). If you were to look more specifically into the U.S., on a city level, the top places for fast food are `r get_summary_info(data)$top_cities`. This gives us a geographic understanding of how the fast food resturants are spread. But what are the names of the actual resturants that have the most influence in country? The data suggests that `r get_summary_info(data)$top_r` (in no particular order) are the most popular. The top restaurant: `r get_summary_info(data)$top_r[2]`, having a grand total of `r get_summary_info(data)$tot_subway` locations.
