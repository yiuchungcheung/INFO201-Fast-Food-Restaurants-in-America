      <p id="first_paragraph"><b>Topic Inspiration</b></p>
      
      When someone utters the questions, "Where should we eat" or "what should we eat," a lot of us end up pausing, bombarded with the numerous options that exist. From sushi to pizza, it seems like there's something for everyone. But here in United States, we are especially known for a specfic type... Fast food. With the increasing busyness of everyone's lives, restaurants have honed in on increasing the speed, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness of our meals. From a more specific perspective, we understand fast food is immensely prevalent within the lives of us college students. With tuition and housing bills piling up, buying from the $1 menu at McDonald's tends to be the last ditch effort of feeding ourselves. With desire to understand this topic, we looked at a dataset from Datafiniti. This included a sample of 10,000 restaurant locations, scattered across the United States. The purpose of our project is to understand this <em>nation-wide distribution</em>, a little bit better.

      With the information given we are aiming to answer the questions of:
      
      <br>

      1. What are the most popular food chains (by name)? : 'Popularity' is measured on the basis of total number of locations and how wide spread they are.
      
      <br>
      
      2. Where are these most popular fast food chains? : Where in United States can you find these specific restaurants and how they are distributed.
      
      <br>
      
      3. What states have the highest concentrations of these fast food chains? : The specific states in which have the most fast food restaurants according to the data
