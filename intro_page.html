      When someone utters the questions, "Where should we eat" or "What should we eat," a lot of us end up pausing, bombarded with the numerous options that exist. From sushi to pizza, it seems like there's something for everyone. But here in United States, we are especially known for a specfic type... Fast food. With the increasing busyness of everyone's lives, restaurants have honed in on increasing the speed, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness of our meals. 
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      From a more specific perspective, we understand fast food is immensely prevalent within the lives of us college students. With tuition and housing bills piling up, buying from the $1 menu at McDonald's tends to be our last ditch effort in feeding ourselves. 
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      With desire to understand this fast food craze, here in the U.S., we looked at a dataset from Datafiniti. This included a sample of 10,000 restaurant locations, scattered across the United States. The purpose of our project is to understand this <em>nation-wide distribution</em>, a little bit better.

      <p id="second_paragraph"><b>Main Questions We Are Trying To Answer</b></p>
      
      With the information given we are aiming to answer the questions of:
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      1. What are the most popular food chains (by name)? : 'Popularity' is measured on the basis of total number of locations and how wide spread they are.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      2. Where are these most popular fast food chains? : Where in United States can you find these specific restaurants and how they are distributed.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      3. What states have the highest concentrations of these fast food chains? : The specific states in which have the most fast food restaurants according to the data
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      <p id="third_paragraph"><b>What to Expect</b></p>
      
       Our Project is broken down into general visual analyses for the questions above. 
      
       <br>
       <br>
       
       The map: This is a visual representation to show us the general trend of some of the top fast food resturants in the country.
       
       <br>
       <br>
       
       The bar graph: This shows us the breakdown of the top states in which fast food is most prevalent.
       
       <br>
       <br>
       
       The pie chart: This displays the top fast food chains and is broken down by percentages.
       
       <br>
       <br>
       
       Summary: A concise wrap up of all our findings.
