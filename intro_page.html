      When someone utters the questions, "Where should we eat" or "What should we eat," a lot of us end up pausing, bombarded with the numerous options that exist. From sushi to pizza, it seems like there's something for everyone. But here in United States, we are especially known for a specfic type... Fast food. With the increasing busyness of everyone's lives, restaurants have honed in on increasing the speed, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness of our meals. From a more specific perspective, we understand fast food is immensely prevalent within the lives of us college students. With tuition and housing bills piling up, buying from the $1 menu at McDonald's tends to be the last ditch effort in feeding ourselves. With desire to understand this topic, we looked at a dataset from Datafiniti. This included a sample of 10,000 restaurant locations, scattered across the United States. The purpose of our project is to understand this <em>nation-wide distribution</em>, a little bit better.
